              <p>
                Dabble was born from a simple yet powerful observation: the most profound breakthroughs 
                emerge when deep strategic thinking dances with fearless experimentation. We exist at 
                the intersection of playful exploration and rigorous intellectual inquiry.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rooted in Stanford's proven innovation methodologies, we've assembled a living system 
                for generating what's next. We're not just a consultancy or a product lab‚Äîwe're a 
                collective consciousness designed to transform complexity into clarity, challenges into opportunities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our size is intentional. Twelve brilliant minds, each bringing unique perspectives from 
                engineering to anthropology, data science to poetry. Large enough for diverse expertise, 
                small enough for true collaboration and shared consciousness that larger firms cannot replicate.
