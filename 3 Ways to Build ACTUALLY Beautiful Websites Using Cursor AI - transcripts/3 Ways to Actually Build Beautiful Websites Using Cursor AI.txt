00:00 are you struggling to turn beautiful
00:02 website designs into actual working code
00:04 with cursor you're not alone in my
00:06 previous video about building beautiful
00:08 websites with cursor you guys absolutely
00:10 loved it and it got an amazing response
00:13 here's the thing though in that video I
00:14 actually showed you how you can get a
00:16 beautiful UI but I didn't show you how
00:18 you could properly implement it you
00:20 can't just go ahead and tell cursor this
00:22 is the design file or use this reference
00:24 ask it to clone it and then expect it to
00:26 work it'll actually start to build stuff
00:28 on its own which usually ends up as
00:30 hallucination or AI slop that no one
00:32 really likes so in today's video I'm
00:34 going to tell you three ways you can
00:36 actually build the beautiful UI that you
00:38 created whether you're coming from my
00:40 previous video or you're completely new
00:42 here by the end of this you'll know
00:44 exactly how to get cursor to build the
00:46 websites you actually want so in the
00:48 previous video I actually shared a
00:50 prompt that allowed you to convert any
00:52 design image you gave to an AI model
00:54 like claude or chatgpt into JSON format
00:57 then using that JSON format you could
00:60 accurately create a design template and
01:02 reuse it anywhere well I've also
01:03 improved that prompt a little bit and
01:05 made some changes so that the JSON
01:07 output is even better you'll find this
01:09 updated prompt in the description as
01:11 well but to start building projects you
01:13 can actually scale you need this first
01:15 method so let's go ahead and get started
01:17 this is actually a pretty powerful
01:19 prompt template that we've developed
01:20 instead of cursor guessing what you want
01:22 this injects the full functionality and
01:25 structure of your front-end app right
01:27 into the AI's context from the start
01:29 there are specific prompt fields to fill
01:31 out first the required pages that need
01:33 to be made then user roles and
01:35 permissions for authentication if you
01:37 want authentication in your app which is
01:39 actually very important for real
01:41 projects then you absolutely need to
01:43 include this shared components are also
01:45 mentioned like navigation bar header and
01:48 breadcrumbs then we have modals and
01:50 pop-ups which if you list them at the
01:52 beginning really helps because the AI
01:54 will develop the front-end app
01:55 accordingly and everything gets
01:57 integrated properly there are also
01:59 technical requirements you can include
02:01 which make it way easier to connect the
02:02 app to a back end later on and you can
02:04 specify whichever framework you want to
02:06 use for your app the best part is you
02:08 don't even have to fill this out
02:10 yourself if you don't want to for
02:11 example you can see that I gave the
02:13 prompt to Claude and it just went ahead
02:15 and filled everything out for me and the
02:17 reason I gave this prompt to Claude is
02:18 what I want to demo so I wanted to make
02:21 a weather app with the style and design
02:23 of the cursor landing page you can see
02:25 it has this gradient infused layout
02:27 where the same gradient is used
02:29 throughout all the components what I did
02:31 was take around six or seven screenshots
02:33 put them into Claude and gave it the
02:35 prompt that produces the JSON output you
02:37 saw earlier claude then generated the
02:39 JSON for creating a web app with the
02:41 cursor UI design profile since I wanted
02:44 to build the full front end of the
02:46 weather app I told it I'd be using
02:48 Nex.js with Tailwind so I specified the
02:50 framework i also asked it to fill out
02:52 the front-end template we looked at
02:54 earlier and it did exactly that it
02:56 created the required pages the user
02:58 roles and permissions the modles and
03:00 pop-ups and it even added technical
03:02 requirements because we gave the full
03:04 prompt to Claude it could pre-plan all
03:06 the components that need to be made that
03:08 means cursor or any AI agent you're
03:10 using doesn't have to guess or figure
03:12 out what components to create and you
03:14 don't have to face the frustration and
03:16 you can always go back and edit things
03:18 later nothing here is set in stone all
03:21 right let me show you the first method
03:23 in action you can see that I'm in cursor
03:25 right now and this is the design.json
03:27 file that I have open here this is the
03:29 JSON file we got from Claude after that
03:32 I asked cursor to install a nextjs app i
03:35 gave it the full prompt that claude
03:36 filled out using the template i told
03:38 cursor build the front-end app in this
03:41 nextjs app and for the design strictly
03:43 follow the design.json that I provided
03:46 it went ahead and started creating the
03:48 app now it did take some time and there
03:50 were some version conflicts that cursor
03:52 couldn't handle so I brought in clawed
03:54 code to help fix those and this is the
03:56 website it generated you can see that it
03:59 accurately follows the gradient design
04:01 we saw on the cursor landing page in the
04:03 prompt I specifically asked it to focus
04:05 on how the gradients were created which
04:07 is why it looks exactly like this if you
04:09 look at the cards below you'll notice
04:11 they also mirror how the cards were
04:13 styled on the cursor landing page the
04:15 rest of that page was mostly clean and
04:17 dark so there wasn't much else to pick
04:19 up from the JSON but as you can see it
04:21 nailed the gradient design perfectly now
04:23 I want to be transparent here this
04:25 design wasn't perfect on the first try
04:27 cursor made some mistakes that I had to
04:29 correct but it provided an excellent
04:31 foundation to work from later on I'll
04:33 also show how you can accurately do that
04:36 as well oh and if you're enjoying the
04:38 content we're making I'd really
04:40 appreciate it if you hit that subscribe
04:41 button we're also testing out channel
04:43 memberships launched the first tier as a
04:45 test and 79 people have joined so far
04:48 the support's been incredible so we're
04:50 thinking about launching additional
04:51 tiers right now members get priority
04:54 replies to your comments perfect if you
04:56 need feedback or have questions now the
04:58 second method is perfect for when you
05:00 want to copy the structure of an
05:02 existing site and then apply your own
05:04 design on top of it this is incredibly
05:06 useful because instead of building
05:07 everything from scratch you can leverage
05:09 proven layouts and just make them your
05:11 own for that you can use this amazing
05:13 tool called Browser MCP it's completely
05:16 free and I'll link it in the description
05:18 so you can grab it right after this
05:19 video browser MCP has two parts you need
05:22 to set up but don't worry it's
05:24 straightforward first install the
05:26 browser extension from the Chrome Web
05:27 Store this extension is what allows the
05:29 tool to actually interact with web pages
05:32 then for any page you want to clone you
05:34 just connect browser MCP to that
05:36 specific tab like this second you need
05:38 to set up the MCP server inside cursor
05:41 itself go to their documentation and in
05:43 the install section find the setup for
05:46 your IDE and paste the config into your
05:48 MCP.json JSON file pretty
05:50 straightforward and their documentation
05:52 walks you through everything once that's
05:54 done I recommend using the prompt you
05:56 see here and filling it with the link of
05:58 the website that you want to clone now I
06:00 choose the monkey type website as an
06:02 example but honestly its structure is
06:04 pretty simple so there wasn't much to
06:06 copy but even with this basic site it
06:08 still did a solid job which shows you
06:10 how powerful this method really is
06:12 here's why it works so well this MCP
06:15 actually spins up a real browser and
06:17 navigates like a real person would it's
06:19 not just scraping HTML it's actually
06:21 experiencing the site you can see it has
06:23 a browser screenshot tool that takes
06:25 screenshots helping it understand not
06:27 just the code but the actual visual
06:29 structure and layout perfectly in the
06:31 prompt I tell it to explore the website
06:33 thoroughly and break down the
06:35 architecture navigation patterns and
06:37 styling approaches if you want to use
06:39 your own design with the JSON method
06:41 from earlier just remove that part from
06:43 the prompt and it'll focus purely on
06:45 structure after it gathers all the data
06:47 from its exploration I asked it to build
06:49 the clone in next.js and here's the
06:52 result it created this fully functional
06:54 site i can type in it it catches errors
06:57 properly different modes and pages work
06:59 seamlessly because it actually navigated
07:02 and understood how the original site
07:04 functions not just how it looks now this
07:06 method gives you the perfect foundation
07:08 and structure but what about when you
07:09 need to apply your own custom design on
07:12 top or make precise tweaks to specific
07:14 elements that's where method 3 comes in
07:16 and it's a game changer so the third
07:19 method focuses on something that's
07:21 absolutely crucial making precise UI
07:23 tweaks without breaking everything else
07:25 what I'm going to show you is how to get
07:27 this interactive bar that lets you
07:29 select individual or even multiple
07:31 elements and send them back to Cursor
07:33 with exact details about their location
07:35 and what those elements are this
07:37 eliminates the guesswork and ensures
07:39 Cursor knows precisely what to edit
07:41 without messing up the rest of your site
07:43 and trust me this precision is
07:44 everything when you're working on real
07:46 projects where one wrong change can
07:48 break your entire layout the setup is
07:50 actually really simple but the results
07:52 are powerful just go into cursor open
07:54 the extensions tab and search for stage
07:56 wise install it then open your command
07:59 pallet with command plus shift + p type
08:01 stage wise and it'll bring up all the
08:03 related commands you need here's
08:05 something important to keep in mind you
08:07 have to set up stage wise in each
08:09 project individually it actually
08:11 modifies your code and sets everything
08:13 up automatically for that specific
08:15 project just select the appropriate
08:16 option and it will enter a prompt into
08:18 your cursor agent telling it to
08:20 initialize the stage wise bar in your
08:22 project i've already done that setup
08:24 here and as you can see it ran the full
08:26 prompt and set everything up perfectly
08:29 now I have this powerful tool where I
08:31 can select each element individually and
08:33 send it back to cursor with exactly how
08:35 I want it edited no more vague
08:37 instructions that could be
08:38 misinterpreted for example look at this
08:41 restart button right now it's just plain
08:43 text and only becomes a button when I
08:45 hover over it that's a small UI tweak
08:47 but this is exactly where stage wise
08:49 becomes super handy if I just went back
08:52 and told cursor to update the restart
08:54 button there's a chance it might fix it
08:55 correctly but there's also a chance it
08:57 might break or alter something else
08:59 entirely which I obviously don't want
09:01 instead I can be surgical about it i
09:03 open the prompt box select the exact
09:05 element I want to change and write
09:07 precisely what I want like adding a
09:09 proper hover animation and making it
09:11 consistent with the rest of the UI when
09:13 I send that prompt and go back to cursor
09:15 you'll see something amazing it includes
09:17 all the accurate data the element's
09:19 exact location in the code what I want
09:22 changed and other useful context
09:24 information i send the prompt and as you
09:26 can see the button has been updated
09:28 perfectly it now matches the rest of the
09:30 UI with this yellowish theme and when I
09:32 hover over it there's a subtle animation
09:35 and this is exactly what I wanted this
09:37 level of precision is what separates
09:39 amateur projects from professional ones
09:41 and Stage Wise makes it accessible to
09:43 everyone that brings us to the end of
09:45 this video if you missed my previous
