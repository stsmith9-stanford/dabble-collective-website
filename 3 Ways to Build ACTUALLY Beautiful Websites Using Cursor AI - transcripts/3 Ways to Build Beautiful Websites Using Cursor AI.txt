00:00 let's be honest your AI generated
00:02 websites look terrible and I know
00:04 exactly why you're going into cursor or
00:06 claude and just typing make it beautiful
00:09 or make it look professional then
00:11 wondering why you end up with the same
00:12 boring generic designs that look like
00:15 every other AI built site out there the
00:17 problem isn't the AI it's how you're
00:19 using it today I'm going to show you
00:21 three proven methods and some
00:22 game-changing tricks that will
00:24 completely elevate your websites and
00:26 make them look absolutely stunning so
00:28 jumping right into it the first method
00:30 is to take a design that's already been
00:32 made and clone it perfectly here's how
00:34 it works you need to extract a proper
00:37 design profile from whatever you want to
00:39 replicate for example I grabbed this
00:41 random design if I want to make a
00:43 website web app or mobile app that looks
00:45 exactly like this I can ask any AI
00:48 claude chat GPT whatever to create a
00:51 JSON design system that extracts all the
00:53 visual data from what I've provided then
00:55 I give this JSON output to cursor and
00:58 boom consistent styling the output
00:60 should include the style structure and
01:02 I'll give the AI some autonomy to decide
01:05 anything else that helps replicate this
01:07 design perfectly and here we have it our
01:09 design system JSON file with all the
01:11 data we need to replicate this design
01:13 now let's actually test it out and see
01:15 if it works so here's what we did we
01:18 gave it a prompt to build a
01:19 comprehensive educational dashboard with
01:21 all the features we needed notice we
01:23 didn't mention anything about design in
01:24 the prompt itself we just told it we
01:26 needed the app in HTML CSS and
01:29 JavaScript and to follow the design.json
01:32 file this is that file i pasted the JSON
01:34 that Claude generated and told cursor to
01:37 follow it and look at what it created
01:39 this beautiful looking app that clearly
01:41 matches our target design we've got
01:43 these clean notifications an attractive
01:45 layout that matches exactly what we were
01:47 going for and even this sleek navigation
01:49 bar the result it cloned the design
01:52 almost perfectly this is the power of
01:54 giving AI a proper design system instead
01:56 of just saying make it pretty so method
01:59 one was perfect when you had a design to
02:01 copy but what if you want to create
02:03 something completely original well for
02:05 that I have this amazing website called
02:07 Tweak CN basically it lets you create
02:10 your own perfect Shad CN UI setup from
02:12 scratch if you don't know what Shad CN
02:14 UI is or you're not familiar with
02:16 components don't worry i'll show
02:18 examples that'll make the concept clear
02:20 when you visit this website and start
02:22 customizing you'll see this preview
02:24 interface they've given us on the left
02:26 you have options for customizing it
02:28 however you want for example I'm in the
02:30 colors tab right now and we can change
02:32 the color to anything we want you can
02:34 see the color changing as I drag the
02:36 slider and that's just the primary color
02:38 we can also change the accent colors
02:40 base colors and even the card colors so
02:43 everything is completely customizable
02:45 and not only colors but typography as
02:47 well we can change the fonts too if we
02:49 go into others there are more options
02:51 one of them is shadow which adjusts the
02:53 shadow of the components it completely
02:55 gives you the ability to customize
02:57 however you want let me show you if you
02:59 just shuffle these you'll see the
03:00 different types of customizations and
03:02 themes you can create and if these are
03:04 just the default options imagine what
03:06 you could design yourself and this is
03:08 just the cards tab if we go to dashboard
03:10 or mail tabs there are more previews as
03:13 well it gives you everything including
03:15 dark mode and light mode so you know how
03:17 your app looks in both themes if you
03:19 like what you've created go to the code
03:21 tab copy the code paste it into an
03:23 index.css file in your directory just
03:26 like method one then ask cursor to build
03:28 your project from this file now methods
03:30 one and two were great for getting the
03:33 overall design and styling right but
03:35 here's method three and this one's all
03:37 about taking your apps to the next level
03:39 with premium components so another way
03:42 to make your websites or apps look
03:44 really really good especially if you're
03:46 making web apps with React is by using
03:48 React components which honestly look
03:50 amazing for example we have this library
03:52 right here called React Bits which gives
03:54 you animated React components i'm going
03:57 to show you these components in a bit
03:59 and they look pretty awesome but this
04:00 isn't the only library there are
04:02 actually a lot of other component
04:04 libraries out there and many people find
04:06 Aceternity UI pretty good as well some
04:08 of these libraries are paid but even in
04:10 those you'll find free components that
04:12 are really worth using as opposed to
04:14 just going ahead and telling AI to
04:16 generate everything by itself so let's
04:19 go ahead and actually use some
04:20 components from this React Bits library
04:22 in our app and let me show you how the
04:24 process works as well let's take this
04:26 landing page as our example it's just a
04:29 standard landing page nothing impressive
04:31 about it i came into cursor told it to
04:33 install a Next.js app and create a
04:35 landing page with six sections i could
04:38 customize later cursor set everything up
04:40 and created the whole thing now I want
04:42 to upgrade this with custom components
04:44 you can see in our powerful features
04:46 section we have these basic cards what
04:48 if I want to make these cards look
04:50 absolutely amazing here in React Bits
04:52 there's this component called tinted
04:54 card look at this effect it makes the
04:56 card 3D and as you move around it it
04:59 tilts this is exactly what I want to add
05:01 another amazing thing is you can
05:03 customize the component before copying
05:05 it into your app you can install it
05:06 directly or just get the code which is
05:09 what I'm going to do first i'm copying
05:11 the entire component code notice it has
05:13 a prerequisite framer motion which needs
05:16 to be installed for the component to
05:17 work correctly now heading back into
05:19 cursor I'm going to tell it exactly what
05:22 I want name the section where this
05:24 should be implemented tell it to use the
05:26 component I'm providing as the card for
05:28 that specific section and make sure it
05:30 installs the framer motion dependency
05:32 here's the component code I copied and
05:34 I'm giving this whole thing as a prompt
05:36 to cursor right now cursor is done
05:38 generating the code it took its time but
05:41 now let me show you how these component
05:43 cards turned out this is the features
05:45 section we had before and now watch this
05:47 if I hover over the cards and move the
05:49 cursor around it has that exact same
05:52 rotation effect we saw in the component
05:54 library and it works perfectly on all
05:56 the cards now I'll be honest I did run
05:58 into some errors during integration
05:60 sometimes when components are more
06:02 complex you might hit a few bumps for
06:04 example the tinted card component I used
06:06 had a background image in the original
06:08 code cursor automatically added a stock
06:10 placeholder image when it saw that I had
06:12 to ask it to remove the background image
06:14 which it did without any issues and
06:16 here's our final result smooth 3D
06:19 tilting cards that look absolutely
06:21 professional compared to the basic ones
06:23 we started with oh and if you're
06:25 enjoying the content we're making I'd
06:27 really appreciate it if you hit that
06:29 subscribe button we're also testing out
06:31 channel memberships launched the first
06:32 tier as a test and 50 people jumped in
06:35 immediately the support's been
06:36 incredible so we're thinking about
06:38 launching additional tiers right now
06:40 members get priority replies to your
06:42 comments perfect if you need feedback or
06:44 have questions now those three methods
06:46 will give you the foundation for amazing
06:49 looking apps but there are some
06:50 essential techniques beyond that crucial
06:52 details that separate amateur projects
06:55 from professional ones let's talk about
06:57 animations if you want to add animations
06:59 to your websites or apps here's the
07:01 golden rule don't overdo it ask it to
07:03 animate everything and your site will
07:05 look unprofessional and distracting so
07:08 how do you do this right for any 3D
07:10 effect you want just ask chat GPT or
07:12 Claude to tell you exactly how to prompt
07:14 cursor to add that specific effect to
07:17 whatever section you want but if you
07:19 want smooth animations and micro
07:20 interactions that actually elevate your
07:23 website focus on these types of effects
07:25 subtle movements that every professional
07:28 site needs just mention the exact effect
07:30 you want and AI will implement it
07:32 perfectly the key is being specific
07:34 about the animation you want not just
07:36 saying make it animated another crucial
07:39 element that instantly elevates your
07:41 design is the fonts you choose using
07:43 fonts that actually match your project's
07:45 vibe can take it from amateur to
07:47 professional in seconds take our landing
07:49 page here if I want to change the main
07:51 text in the hero section where do I find
07:53 the right fonts how do I explore options
07:55 that actually work google Fonts is your
07:58 best resource they have an extensive
07:60 library with different artistic styles
08:02 and amazing filters to help you find
08:04 exactly what you're looking for for
08:06 example I found this font that's perfect
08:08 for my hero section i'll open it up and
08:10 hit the get font button here's the get
08:12 embedded code option this gives you the
08:14 code to embed in your project making the
08:16 font instantly available now I'm heading
08:18 back into cursor i'll give it the
08:20 embedded code so it can import the font
08:22 and tell it to apply this to the main
08:24 heading in the hero section back to the
08:26 website and look at that the font is
08:28 applied and it honestly makes the
08:30 website look dramatically better it's
08:32 amazing how much difference the right
08:34 typography makes now I know you've heard
08:36 that you need to be specific with AI but
08:39 many people miss this point every single
08:41 day a perfect example is designing
08:43 layouts you can't just say make an app
08:46 or make a site responsive it'll get the
08:48 job done but it won't be perfect and
08:50 there will still be bugs instead specify
08:52 the exact layout you want like here I
08:55 told it to create a bento layout that
08:57 becomes a single column on mobile i
08:59 purposely specified how the layout
09:01 should function and I put this into a
09:03 file so I could show you the results
09:05 look at this bento layout we have these
09:07 cards arranged perfectly now if I switch
09:10 this to mobile view you can see the
09:12 cards seamlessly transition into a
09:14 single column creating a much better
09:16 user experience and here are some
09:17 examples of other layouts you can
09:19 specify and implement in your own
09:21 applications i'll also leave some links
09:24 to other resources you can use to make
09:26 your websites and apps even more
09:27 beautiful definitely go ahead and check
09:29 them out most importantly try at least
09:32 one of these methods and implement it in
09:34 your own app you'll be amazed at the
09:35 difference it makes that brings us to
